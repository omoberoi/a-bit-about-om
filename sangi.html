    <h1>Sangi</h1>
    <p>Sangi's drive is to find the all blue. The all blue is a place where <br> 
    fish from the east blue, west blue, north blue and the south blue all gather a chef's dream. (Well a seafood chef.) <br>
When Sangi was young he nearly starved then made a seafood restraunt with the help of red foot zef. He was trained in the art of fighting <br>
because the restraunt had a lot of pirate trafic and everyone should expect a fight.</p>
