<h1>Luffy</h1>
    <p>Luffy is our most important person. <br>
        When he was young he ate a devil fruit, this made him a ruber man stretching his body parts at will <br>
        but forever taking his abillity to swim. <br>
        on his journy to become the king of the pirates not swiming is a big take away.</p>
