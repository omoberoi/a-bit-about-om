    <h1>Nami</h1>
    <p>What Nami wants to accomplish is a chart of the whole world. As a kid she worked for the <br>
    pirate that inslaved her village because for one hunderd million barries she would buy her village back. After Luffy destroyed Arlong (the inslaver of Nami's village) <br>
she is free to chart what ever she wants.</p>
