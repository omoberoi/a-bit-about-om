    <h1>Zoro</h1>
    <P>Zoro is a swords man he can beat Luffy in battle only because Luffy has a weakness to sharp things. <br>
    When Zoro was young he promised his rival that one of them would be the best swords men in the world but she died two days after they made the deal so <br>
    Zoro had the burden of becoming the best swords man in the world (witch nearly killed him a thousand times).</P>
